# GenomicDataScienceCert
A repository for code and a diary while pursuing Genomic Data Science certificate on Coursera. All code will be uploaded as notebooks with comments. All external public data will be linked in comments. Decided to try one of these Coursera Pro certificates. The MOOC world has been interesting to watch, and I want to see what it's all about, so here we are. Given my background and career interests, this seems like a natural test case. 

###### (Day 1) Initial lessons and as such commits are pretty basic. Finished first course in about 2 hours. Watched all videos, completed all lessons.
###### Starting second course and...ya know, here we are.
